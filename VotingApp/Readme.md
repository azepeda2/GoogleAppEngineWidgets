	The project was originally developed and run through the google app engine. The code includes usage 
	of Google's database including their implementation of SQL known as GQL, as well as session data. 
	The app takes the users vote and checks the database for the entry. If the entry is in the database, 
	it adds the vote it, if not, it creates an entry for it in the table.
