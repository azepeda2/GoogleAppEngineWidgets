	The project was originally developed and run through the google app engine. The code includes usage 
	of Google's database including their implementation of SQL known as GQL, as well as session data. 
	The program stores the users first name, last name, email, password, and age. It allows the system 
	to search the users in the database or add them if they are not yet in it.
